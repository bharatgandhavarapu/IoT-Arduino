<p>DLL is short of Dynamic Link Library, a library of executable functions or data that can be used by Windows applications. DLL provides one or more particular functions, program accesses the functions by creating either a static or dynamic link to the DLL. A static link remains constant during program execution while a dynamic link is created by the program as needed. DLLs can also contain just data. DLL files end with the extension ".dll".</p>
